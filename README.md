# Real-Time-Streaming-with-Azure-Databricks
# Project Overview
Welcome to the "Real-Time Streaming with Azure Databricks" repository. This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for real-time data streaming and analysis using Azure Databricks and Azure Event Hubs, with visualization in Power BI . This streaming pipeline project is based on medallion architecture.

1. Data Sources: Streaming data from IoT devices or social media feeds. (Simulated in Event Hubs)
2. Ingestion: Azure Event Hubs for capturing real-time data.
3. Processing: Azure Databricks for stream processing using Structured Streaming.
4. Storage: Processed data stored Azure Data Lake (Delta Format).
5. Visualisation: Data visualized using Power BI.
